This project is a countdown timer for Diwali 2024, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
The timer dynamically counts down to the exact date and time of Diwali, showing the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

<h2>Customization</h2><br>
To change the countdown date, open the script.js file and modify the endDate variable:

const endDate="1 November 2024 12:00 AM";<br>
You can also update the CSS in styles.css to match your preferred color scheme or layout.
